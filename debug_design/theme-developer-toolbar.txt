A full theme editor would:

 * Use debug toolbar as a base
 * Enable editing of templates
 * Show context variables available
 * Allow editing of css, uploading of static images
 * Use folders to create new themes, so different ones can be used
 * Use a template loader module to choose the selected theme
 * Each theme is a git repository with undo/redo
 * No caching of templates (warn if caching is used)
