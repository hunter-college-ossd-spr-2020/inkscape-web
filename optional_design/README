How to
======

Creating an optional design can be done in two ways, one, if you are committing to the repository then you can add items to the sub-directories here in `optional_design/static` and `optional_design/templates`.

These folders should contain a sub-directory with the name of your alernate design. So if your new design is called 'apples', you should make a directory `optional_design/static/apples` and the directory `optional_design/templates/apples`, then populate those directories with replacement html, css and other files.

Any file that you miss, will use the site's default style or template instead. You may end up with a mix-and-match design if you don't plan out your results carefully.

Finally, test your design. Much of django's templating engine will cause server errors if you don't use the right tags or mis-spell a url name. Testing with a working local version is the cleanest way of making sure you don't bork your design on live.
