Seems pretty interesting to me. If my schedule allows, I'd love to  
make it. Might even be a chance for my wife and I both to come up. At  
the moment plane tickets aren't too bad. I just need to check on a  
few things my wife has sometime during that month. If not, we could  
call it a weekend getaway.  :-)

I'm not sure how many people we'd need to be able to make a booth  
work (that is, if number of people is the only booth problem). How  
many people we could sponsor to make a difference would be something  
to look at.

I personally feel that it would be nice if Inkscape could have a  
presence there.

Hey guys,

So I got this e-mail, which is kinda interesting.  I don't know about
attending the event though.  I don't think that I can attend the
event.
And considering I don't know that we have anyone local in SF, it would
probably involve sponsoring someone to go.  It seems like a good
offer,
but I don't believe that we can have a booth.  I wanted to see what
others thought.
