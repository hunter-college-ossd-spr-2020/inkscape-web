So, I think this whole thing has brought up issues with all these
topics.  Probably stuff that we should start resolving.

I think the first thing that we need to determine is who owns them now.

The name, I'm pretty sure that's Mental's.

The logo, I think there is probably a few people owning Copyright there.
I remember coming into IRC and Mental showing me the logo, but I don't
really know what went on before that.  Also, with the latest revamp of
the logo, who did that?  Was it Andy?

Let's get this first.  What does everyone else think?

Also, I hope that I didn't offend anyone by suggesting it was okay to
use the logo when I don't have any claims of copyright of the work.  I
didn't mean to -- I'm just excited about the idea of having a printed
Inkscape work (in English -- the French one was cool at LGM, but not
useful to me)
