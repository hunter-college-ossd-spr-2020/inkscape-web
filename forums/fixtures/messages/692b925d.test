I agree.  But, I think that it shows that we don't oppose it's usage.
Which, until we figure out who exactly can do what, is all we can do.  I
think it's useful to say "the Inkscape project thinks it's okay" without
saying "the legal owner gives permission."

What I think we can do legally is provide a 'vote of confidence' for the
owner(s) of the logo to give permission for its use.  But I don't think
our vote alone would be sufficient for permission.
