I've always wanted a GPG password safe, that could allow for storing and
sharing credentials between multiple parties in a secure fashion. Is
there anything like that out there?

Incidentally, this brings up another issue -- we need to work out a
scheme for securely storing/sharing the login information for various
accounts which we create in the name of the organization, so the
credentials are available to any of the board members if required
(though for sanity's sake each account should probably still have a
particular board member being primarily responsible for it,
internally).  Any ideas on that front?
