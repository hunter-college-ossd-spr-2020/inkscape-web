I think it came down to "unclear" but I think it was determined to be 
GPL.  The problem there is that GPL is an unclear license for art.  So, 
that's why I suggested that he e-mail this list.   I figured if there 
was any "unclear" that would be resolved by approval of the board.

But, I think we need to clear up licensing, and get a license agreement 
setup.  I talked with the SFLC folks about this type of stuff at OSCON.  
They're willing to help with doing all that.  I said that I'd send them 
details, but I haven't yet.  Also, with getting together what we need to 
get the "Inkscape" trademark together.

I'm +1 too. But what's the licensing on our icons? I seem to remember
a mailing list thread about that.

I have no problem with this, and I think the shirts are cool.  The only
requirement for me is that we need someway for me to order one ;)
