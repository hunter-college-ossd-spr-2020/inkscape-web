Ah, indeed it does.

6. Representation of the Project in the Conservancy. The Developers, 
each a signatory hereto, shall represent the Project in its official
communication with the Conservancy. There shall be seven Developers 
(together, the "Committee"), elected by the community members of the 
Project listed in the Project's AUTHORS file (the "Community Members"). 
Each Developer shall continue to serve until he or she resigns from the 
position. The Developers may be removed from the position at any time by 
a majority vote of the Community Members. Upon the resignation or 
removal of a Developer, the Community Members shall elect a replacement 
Developer to serve on the Committee. The Committee will elect a single 
individual to communicate with the Conservancy (the "Representative") 
and shall notify the Conservancy promptly following the election of a 
new Representative. The Representative will have the authority to 
instruct the Conservancy on the Project's behalf on all matters. This 
section may be modified by a vote of at least 3/4 of the Community 
Members, with the consent of the Conservancy, such consent not to be 
unreasonably withheld.

So the community should be notified and we should hold an election.

I believe that's spelled out in our charter, though I can't
find my copy at the moment.  I guess we also need to make sure
that any public records are updated to reflect the change
in the board membership.

Ps. How do we go about replacing our lost board member?
