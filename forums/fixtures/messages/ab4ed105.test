Hello board,

In talking with Ted about this, it seems like it's worth bringing forth
to the board.

Due to some issues out of my control, I won't have available funds to
attend SCALE this year. As sad as it was, I could live with not going.

However, they've now offered us 4 hours of classroom time (2 sessions
that are 2 hours each, one for basic usage, the other for advanced
usage). We do typically have Ted, John Taber, Jon Cruz, and myself there
to man the booth. But, out of all 4 of us, I am probably best qualified
to teach the classes as I know inkscape extremely well from a user
perspective and have used it fairly extensively for illustration,
design, etc.

So, I am requesting if the board would approve funding my attendance
this year to teach the classes (as well as all of my regular duties
there). I've estimated the cost to be $500 for the hotel+taxes & gas to
get to LA & back.

If this is something that other board members would agree to it would
help make for a really great conference this year.
