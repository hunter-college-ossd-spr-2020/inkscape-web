I think that should be fine.  It looks like you're using the toolbar
icons, which are GPL'd and not trademarked in any way.  (In fact, I'm
not sure they're even particular to Inkscape.)

Selling the shirts is fine too - the GPL doesn't forbid charging money
for GPL'd stuff (thus why Linux distros can sell CD's of GPL software)
so there's no moral or legal issue at all.  If you want to be 100%
legit, just post the SVG of your t-shirt design on your website licensed
under GPL and you should be 100% fine.

I emailed Ted Gould a few days ago inquiring if it would be alright to
use Inkscape icons in a promotional t-shirt for the 2008 Ohio LinuxFest.
I wasn't sure who else to ask and since I just recently talked with Ted
through an email on another matter I thought he might be the right guy.
Ted suggested that I contact the Inkscape-board mailing list so here it
goes. Below is my original text from the email that I sent Ted without
his reply.:

Ted,

I am not sure who else to ask from the Inkscape group. Perhaps you can help me with a question.

Richard Querin and I run a website (screencasters.heathenx.org)  that is
dedicated to teaching the basics of Inkscape. We may not be the best
teachers but it's all that we know how to do in terms to spreading the
use of Inkscape. Anyway, I will be attending this years Ohio LinuxFest
just as an attendee and what Richard and I wanted to do is print up a few
t-shirts to give away in order to promote our website (and in turn promte
Inkscape indirectly). We had a few concepts that are questionable in
terms of legal use. We thought it would be neat to have a spoof of a
t-shirt that is sold by Jinx. Instead of the game icons we would use
Inkscape icons. Of course we wondered if it was morally and legally the
right thing to do since we are not affiliated in any shape or form to the
Inkscape project. I attached an image of the concept for you to review.
Can you give us any input here? We certainly do not want to upset the
very project that we both love. Abandoning this t-shirt design is not the
slightest problem. We have plenty more ideas that would not infringe on
Inkscape.

Thank-you.

Regards,

heathenx

The last thing that Richard and I want to do is offend the Inkscape
project. We certainly want to play by the rules. So what does everyone
think? Is this okay? Ted suggested that I might have to offer up the svg
file that is attached if we decide to use this t-shirt design. I don't
have a problem with that.

I would appreciate your input.

Regards,

heathenx

PS. Again, we intend to give a limited amount of these t-shirts away at
the show. We will not be charging for them. However, we may end up
setting up a CafePress store in the future and may or may not offer this
specific shirt for sale...if any of that matters.
