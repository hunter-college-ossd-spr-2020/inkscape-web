Hey all,

I got of the phone from the lawyer from SFLC and they're going to help
us in trademarking the logo and name.  I just wanted to write an e-mail
to make sure I'm not screwing it up :)

Name: Inkscape
Phrase: Draw Freely
Logo: /usr/share/inkscape/icons/inkscape.svg

They are going to do a trademark search to ensure that no one else has
trademarked anything similar (to the point where we'd need to
differentiate) and come up with a "category" for us to file in (I'm
guessing it'll be "computer graphics").

Thoughts after that will be to get a usage policy built that is fairly
simple but ensures that Adobe can't make "Adobe Inkscape" without asking
us first :)

Any issues?
