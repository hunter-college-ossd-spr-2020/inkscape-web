Usually at SCALE the major distro folks are there handing out CDs, so I
don't think it's really a useful thing for us.

I was thinking $1 just because it'd be easy to count and keep track of.
I'm not sure how much stickers would cost, but if we could sell them for
a quarter that'd work too.  I just wanted to reduce the accounting
effort.

Yeah.  Last year we put them on the backdrop, I think a handout might be
good there.  That was really one of my goals with the stickers.

I like trifolds, but I don't know that we wouldn't have to print them in
high color to make Inkscape look good -- and that starts to get
expensive.

My other concern is that I don't want to appear like the .com booths
that are there, I'd rather look like a .org.  While this could seem as a
negative, I do think it's a positive as it controls expectations and
makes us more approachable.  I don't want people to think "we're selling
something" more "we're willing to help."  I think stickers are kooky
enough to make a distinction.


So, it seems in general, people seem supportive of the idea.  I'll ask
Gareth (the SCALE guy) when we'll know on the booth.  I'd hate to have
stickers and no booth :)

Just been at a similar show (ditto mental).  People like to pick up things
for free without even looking at them.  Putting a cost on them says
firstly that you care about them and secondly that they are not
advertising (which is of course not actually true, but that seems to be
perception).  I would charge for them.  Ideally charge as close as
possible to cost price.  You might also get some ubuntu CDs with inkscape
on them to sell for a few $ for people who want to try it.
Finally, make some business cards for inkscape to give out and put
important URLs on it (including inkscape.org, openclipart.org and the
mailing list page).  Otherwise you will spend the day writing them out.
Tri-fold brochures are another idea; people have to unfold them to look
at them, so it at least ensures a minimal amount of interaction.
