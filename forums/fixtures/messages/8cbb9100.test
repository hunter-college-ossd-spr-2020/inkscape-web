Not sure what happened to Nathan, but looks like we have enough votes.

Brad at SFC says the procedure is to forward them documentation about
the decision, details about who to pay, how much, etc.  I'll take care
of this, but I guess the next big thing is to identify who will be
getting it.

I need some advice on this - should we identify the recipients ahead of
time, so they have the money in hand, or do a reimbursement after the
event?

Looks like we have a concensus on this.  I'll work on getting this
payment made with SFC.

Sounds good to me!

So, all those in favor of $1500 for LGM sponsorships say 'aye'!
All those in favor of a $200 donation to OSU for hosting inkscape.org
say 'aye'!
