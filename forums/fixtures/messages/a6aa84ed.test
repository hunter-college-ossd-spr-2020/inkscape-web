One thing I'm curious about is who actually holds the copyright on the
logo?  We haven't yet placed any assets into ownership of the Inkscape
Foundation, so while I like the way the voting is going, I don't think
it would actually give legal permission for use of the logo.

Of course, this opens up a larger issue (which I think mental posed at
the outset), of transferring assets like this into Inkscape Foundation
ownership.

What I think we can do legally is provide a 'vote of confidence' for the
owner(s) of the logo to give permission for its use.  But I don't think
our vote alone would be sufficient for permission.

Hey guys,

I'm guessing you probably already saw my e-mail to -devel, but I wanted
to have something here a little more officially in the record.

All those in favor of allowing Tavmjong Bah to use the Inkscape logo in
the book he is publishing with Prentice Hall please say "Aye".

Me: "Aye"
