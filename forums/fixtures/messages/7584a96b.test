Dear chaps,
As much as I appreciate being on the Inkscape board of directors, now that 
I work for Adobe it is a conflict of interest for me to remain here. 
Please accept my resignation and good wishes for the future.  One day I 
may return and I hope that you'll look after our child in the meantime.
