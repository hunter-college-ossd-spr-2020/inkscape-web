GPL'd, same as the source code.  (Anything can be put under the GPL
despite the code-specific wording of the license - the G stands for
General after all.)

So draw the analogy to source code - someone is free to reuse part of
the inkscape codebase for any purpose including charging for it so long
as they abide by the GPL - the derivative needs to be GPL'd and the
source needs to be available.

I'm +1 too. But what's the licensing on our icons? I seem to remember a
mailing list thread about that.

I have no problem with this, and I think the shirts are cool.  The only
requirement for me is that we need someway for me to order one ;)
