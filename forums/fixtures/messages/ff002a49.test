It should be possible.

Probably not -- it's likely one of those things we can/should handle ourselves.

Yes, it's going to be an issue eventually, so it's best we cover our bases now.

We'll need to ask.

Yeah.  Otherwise we have to be too anal about enforcing things on a case-by-case basis, and that's no fun for anyone.

Sounds good to me.  We should set up a new Cafepress account with the nonprofit's tax information rather than using my personal account.

Incidentally, this brings up another issue -- we need to work out a scheme for securely storing/sharing the login information for various accounts which we create in the name of the organization, so the credentials are available to any of the board members if required (though for sanity's sake each account should probably still have a particular board member being primarily responsible for it, internally).  Any ideas on that front?
