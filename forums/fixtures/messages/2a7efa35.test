Tri-fold brochures are another idea; people have to unfold them to look
at them, so it at least ensures a minimal amount of interaction.

Just been at a similar show (ditto mental).  People like to pick up things
for free without even looking at them.  Putting a cost on them says
firstly that you care about them and secondly that they are not
advertising (which is of course not actually true, but that seems to be
perception).  I would charge for them.  Ideally charge as close as
possible to cost price.  You might also get some ubuntu CDs with inkscape
on them to sell for a few $ for people who want to try it.

Finally, make some business cards for inkscape to give out and put
important URLs on it (including inkscape.org, openclipart.org and the
mailing list page).  Otherwise you will spend the day writing them out.

I submitted the application for us to have a booth at SCALE again this
year.  I was thinking that perhaps we'd have a give away like stickers,
something that says "Inkscape" on it.  I figured we could do the design
via contest.  Anyway, that's really background, what I want to ask is
how the stickers should (if they were approved by the board) be
distributed:

-- Give aways
-- Sell for a $1 donation

I'm kinda thinking give aways, but it seems like a case where we could
make some money and not spend money on people who really don't care,
they just want something for free.

Thoughts?  Ideas?
