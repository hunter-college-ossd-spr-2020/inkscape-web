Hello board,

In talking with Ted about this, it seems like it's worth bringing forth 
to the board.

Due to some issues out of my control, I won't have available funds to 
attend SCALE this year. As sad as it was, I could live with not going.

However, they've now offered us 4 hours of classroom time (2 sessions 
that are 2 hours each, one for basic usage, the other for advanced 
usage). We do typically have Ted, John Taber, Jon Cruz, and myself there 
to man the booth. But, out of all 4 of us, I am probably best qualified 
to teach the classes as I know inkscape extremely well from a user 
perspective and have used it fairly extensively for illustration, 
design, etc.

So, I am requesting if the board would approve funding my attendance 
this year to teach the classes (as well as all of my regular duties 
there). I've estimated the cost to be $500 for the hotel+taxes & gas to 
get to LA & back.

If this is something that other board members would agree to it would 
help make for a really great conference this year.

-Josh
