I'd guess that too, but the explanation that I like better is that it
sends the file into deep space and then encrypts the coordinates to each
user.  Then you pick it up on SETI@Home.  Think, that'd reduce the file
size also!  :)

I guess it just encrypts the one symmetric cypher with all the asymmetric
ones.
