The Linux Fund folks and Bradley from the conservancy discussed that,
and they said that it is possible.

Personally, I'm just a little concerned about paying developers in
general.  I realize that this is a small situation -- but I guess I
worry about the precedent there.

Back in February we and Linux Foundation announced sponsoring Milosz
Derezynski to work on the text tool.

I see that according to http://www.linuxfund.org/projects/inkscape/
there simply wasn't enough funding. Maybe the Inkscape committee could
discuss this and sponsor the project? Our Text tool really demands
attention.
