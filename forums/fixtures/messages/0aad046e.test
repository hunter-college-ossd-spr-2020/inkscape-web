Fully concur on all points.  I frequently see these phenomena at work
at all sorts of conventions.

Just been at a similar show (ditto mental).  People like to pick up things
for free without even looking at them.  Putting a cost on them says
firstly that you care about them and secondly that they are not
advertising (which is of course not actually true, but that seems to be
perception).  I would charge for them.  Ideally charge as close as
possible to cost price.  You might also get some ubuntu CDs with inkscape
on them to sell for a few $ for people who want to try it.

Finally, make some business cards for inkscape to give out and put
important URLs on it (including inkscape.org, openclipart.org and the
mailing list page).  Otherwise you will spend the day writing them out.
