Yes, we do.  Two people that I'd really like in that web are Aaron and
Nathan who I don't believe are going to be there.  Does Andy have a key?
We can get an indirect connection (off to AU) there.  Or, I guess a
quick call with a fingerprint would probably work too.  We can

I can't find keys for Jon Cruz or Nathan Hurst.  The others I have.  Do
you guys have GPG keys?
