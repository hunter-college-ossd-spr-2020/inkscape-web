Well, who came up with them isn't necessarily quite the same as who
"owns" them, from the perspective of a trademark, which is effectively
what we need to be thinking about here.

I came up with it, yes.

All four of us worked on the logo; Andy, Bryce and I did the revamp.

Again, it's really an issue of trademark (if anything) rather than
copyright.

We probably do need to think about asserting trademark on the name and
logo, probably with some permissive policy as Linus has done for the
Linux trademark.

One thing we would need to show is that we are using the trademark in
commerce somehow, at least in a token way.

The name, I'm pretty sure that's Mental's.
The logo, I think there is probably a few people owning Copyright there.
I remember coming into IRC and Mental showing me the logo, but I don't
really know what went on before that.  Also, with the latest revamp of
the logo, who did that?  Was it Andy?
Also, I hope that I didn't offend anyone by suggesting it was okay to
use the logo when I don't have any claims of copyright of the work.  I
didn't mean to -- I'm just excited about the idea of having a printed
