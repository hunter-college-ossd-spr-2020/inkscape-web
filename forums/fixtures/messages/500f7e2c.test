This is extremely unlikely.  On the presumption that such a lawyer thing 
costs real money, perhaps you should to a threat analysis to determine 
what the real legal threats are to inkscape.  I would suggest the 
accidental inclusion of patented or incorrectly licenced code is far more 
likely a problem, and such time would be better spent on that.

Realistically, a large corp wouldn't want the bad pr that came from 
stealing a well known name (and would most likely be immune from attack). 
Small operators rebadging inkscape or using the name are not worth the 
effort/cost of attacking - inkscape is a very well known brand and people 
would quickly socially discourage such behaviour.

Thoughts after that will be to get a usage policy built that is fairly
simple but ensures that Adobe can't make "Adobe Inkscape" without asking
us first :)
