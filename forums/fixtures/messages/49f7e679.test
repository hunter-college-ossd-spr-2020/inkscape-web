Write to this address <conservancy@softwarefreedom.org>

Just send us as much documentation (e.g., notes from a meeting, email
decision) regarding the leadership's decision as is easily available,
along with information about who the money should go to and (if it isn't
clear from the other documentation) a short description of what the
expense is for.
