Hi,

I've a question on how to arrange a donation to OSUOSL from Inkscape.

The Inkscape project has enjoyed being hosted at OSUOSL and our board
has voted to give a $200 donation to say thanks.  However, as an
organization we do not have a credit card, so cannot use the handy web
contribution form.

Is it possible for us to send a check to you?  Who would we mail it to?

Thanks,
Bryce
