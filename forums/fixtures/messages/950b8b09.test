Okay,

Now that we've got some legal structure set up I'm curious if we
shouldn't start looking at things we can/can't/should/shoudn't do.
Here's some ideas floating through my head, I'd love to know everyone's
opinion on them:

- Domain name, should we transfer this to be in the group's name?  Can
we do it?  Does SFC have a process for this?

- Trademarks, etc. on the Inkscape name/logo, "Draw Freely" and other
such stuff.  Do we think this is worthwhile?  Can the SFC lawyers help
us with this or do we need to find an outside firm?

- If we do the above, do we need to draft a little "fair use" document
kinda like the one that Linus has for Linux(tm) (used without
permission)?

- Swag.  I don't know how Mental feels about it, but should we look at
using his, or making another, Cafepress site that marks up the goods
slightly to put monies into our coffers.  It seems that people would
rather buy something marked up than donate (or at least that's the only
logic I can find to all the return address labels I get).

Okay, that's my dump.  Thoughts?  Ideas?
