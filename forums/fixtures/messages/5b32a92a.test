True, but I think in this case probably the closest thing we'll have to
traceability is who created them.

So, perhaps we need to get everyone involved to sign over their
copyright to the foundation?  Does that make sense?

I've talked with SFC about setting up the Cafepress store.  They're
looking into as other groups have asked about it also.  I think that
should be sufficient, if we sold "Inkscape merchandise".  Perhaps we
could put the software on CD there also -- don't know who'd buy it, but
it'd be available.  I guess, probably your store would already be
sufficient.

Well, who came up with them isn't necessarily quite the same as who
"owns" them, from the perspective of a trademark, which is effectively
what we need to be thinking about here.

All four of us worked on the logo; Andy, Bryce and I did the revamp.
We probably do need to think about asserting trademark on the name and
logo, probably with some permissive policy as Linus has done for the
Linux trademark.

One thing we would need to show is that we are using the trademark in
commerce somehow, at least in a token way.

I think the first thing that we need to determine is who owns them now.
The logo, I think there is probably a few people owning Copyright there.
I remember coming into IRC and Mental showing me the logo, but I don't
really know what went on before that.  Also, with the latest revamp of
the logo, who did that?  Was it Andy?
