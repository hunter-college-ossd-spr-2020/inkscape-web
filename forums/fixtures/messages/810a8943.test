Interesting, apparently it set the 'nodupes' option when I signed
everyone up.  I've gone ahead and unchecked that for everyone - if
anyone *does* want nodupes, apologies - you can reset it through the
mailman interface:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/inkscape-board 

Also, I've gone through and compared the settings for -board and -devel
and made them identical.  Mostly just tweaks to how bounces, non-member
posts, etc. are handled.

I didn't get this through the mailing list.  I'm not sure if it's
configured to not send people the same mail twice (with the other
Inkscape lists I get two copies), but I thought I'd mention it.

Okay, I'm all better now.  Is everyone here?
