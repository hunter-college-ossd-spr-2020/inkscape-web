Regarding the costs, please collect receipt(s) and submit to the
consortium for reimbursement with a pointer to this thread to show the
authorization for the $300.

(Do you anticipate any other SCALE-related expenses needing
reimbursement for?)

Hey guys,

Okay, so here is my formal proposal.

I'm thinking that we should get 2000 stickers printed.  There is
supposedly about 5000 people at the conference, but I doubt more than
1000 have ever come by the booth.  I thought about over-printing for
other events, but I think we'd rather run another contest then.  We've
got great artists, I think providing more opportunities is better than
fewer.

Looking at branders.com it looks like a 3" round sticker are about $0.15
a piece.  So that means that I'm asking to spend about $300, hopefully
less as the bulk rates start to kick in.

I would like to have the design be a contest following on the heels of
the amazingly successful 0.46 about screen contest.  The requirements
for the contest being that the Inkscape logo must be visible and it must
have the text "http://inkscape.org" or "www.inkscape.org" in it
somewhere.  I've suggested it to Josh, but I haven't formally asked him
to run it -- he seemed okay with doing it last I asked.

At the conference I'm thinking that we should "charge" a $0.25 donation
for the stickers.  Basically putting a roll of stickers and a bowl of
quarters on the table.  I'll get a couple of rolls of quarters to make
change.  In theory, we could make some money on the whole thing, but the
goal is more to add value to the stickers so they don't just end up
everywhere.

I'll of course post exact dollar amounts as they become available.  Both
for the costs and donations that we take in.

All in favor?
