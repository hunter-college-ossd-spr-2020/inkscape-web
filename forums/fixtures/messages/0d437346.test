Okay, will do.  If, by chance, we make money do I just send them a
check?

Uhm, I can't think of any.  I was thinking we might do the fliers again,
but I thought I'd just print those myself.  I was also thinking about
printing out all of the 0.46 about screens, I love them so much :)

I'm not sure who's all planning to attend, or if we'd want to sponsor
people traveling from afar.  I know I was trying to convince Mental and
John to come, I told them you'd come if they did :)  There's a rumor
that it's just because I want a JPL tour :-O
