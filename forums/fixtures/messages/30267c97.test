Hey guys,

I submitted the application for us to have a booth at SCALE again this
year.  I was thinking that perhaps we'd have a give away like stickers,
something that says "Inkscape" on it.  I figured we could do the design
via contest.  Anyway, that's really background, what I want to ask is
how the stickers should (if they were approved by the board) be
distributed:

-- Give aways
-- Sell for a $1 donation

I'm kinda thinking give aways, but it seems like a case where we could
make some money and not spend money on people who really don't care,
they just want something for free.

Thoughts?  Ideas?
