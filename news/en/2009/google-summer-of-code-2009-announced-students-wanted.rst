`Google's Summer of Code`_ was announced for 2009 recently and Inkscape is going to answer the call! This year the program will have less participants due to difficult global economical situation and no organization can promise that it will be approved to participate, but it still cannot stop us from providing most stunning proposals ever made!

Inkscape has been participating at GSoC from the very beginning (2005) and so far we've been extremely successful — quite a number of GSoC code has become solid foundation for various exciting features. If you want to join us and be part of that ever evolving success, we are looking to `hearing from you`_.

Even though timeline of the program is not announced yet, the time is right to look at the `list`_ of last year's projects ideas or `blueprints`_, some of which have quite verbose descriptions and could make a great start for a project. And of course you are most welcome to suggest your own project!
