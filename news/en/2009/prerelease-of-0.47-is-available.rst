Later than expected we uploaded a prerelease of upcoming Inkscape 0.47. We are working on rescheduling the final release.

The prerelease is currently available as `source code and a Mac build`_ and `binary builds for Ubuntu`_. Fedora users can also use `testing repository`_ to fetch recent builds. Windows binary builds might follow, but you can use `nightly builds`_ for now.

We encourage you to test and `report`_ issues you run into.
