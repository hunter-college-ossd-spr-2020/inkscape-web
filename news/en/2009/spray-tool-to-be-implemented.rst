Last year a small group of French students from École Centrale de Lyon, mentored by Johan Engelen, implemented stacking of live path effects and several very useful LPEs — both to be part of upcoming v0.47.

We are excited to announce that this year another group of students from the same university is going to work on Inkscape to implement Spray tool. Their mentor will be Cedric Gémy.

Stay tuned!
