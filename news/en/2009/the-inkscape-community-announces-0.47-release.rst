After over a year of intensive development and refactoring, Inkscape 0.47 is out. This version of the SVG-based vector graphics editor brings improved performance and tons of new features, some of which are as follows: timed autosave, Spiro splines, auto-smooth nodes, Eraser tool, new modes in Tweak tool, snapping options toolbar & greater snapping abilities, new live path effects (including Envelope), over 200 preset SVG filters, new Cairo-based PS and EPS export, spell checker, many new extensions, optimized SVG code options, and much more.

Additionally, it would be wrong to not mention the hundreds of bug fixes. Check out the `full release notes`_ for more information about what has changed, enjoy the `screenshots`_, or just jump right to `downloading`_ your package for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X.
