Recently Hannes Hochreiner released the first stable version of `JessyInk`_ — a JavaScript that can be incorporated into an Inkscape SVG image containing several layers to create a presentation. Each layer will be converted into one slide of a presentation. With features like slide transition effects, index sheet, master slide and autotext like slide title, slide number and number of slide it makes a perfect excuse to use your favourite browser instead of any of the heavier packages like OpenOffice.org Impress or MS PowerPoint.

Some fixes in Inkscape source code were done by Ted Gould to specifically adress issues reported by Hannes.
