Yesterday the `list of accepted mentoring organizations`_ for `Google Summer of Code 2009`_ was published, and we are chosen again. So if you think that you could do a great project for Inkscape this summer, please read `the list of ideas`_ so far, then `join`_ our developer mailing list and tell us about yourself and your ideas.

Student applications `open on March 23`_, 2009 and close on April 3, 2009. This year there will be less projects than before, so make sure you write a really excellent proposal. We will help you with that.
