Today approved `Google Summer of Code 2009`_ projects were announced, and we have five projects:

- Felipe Sanches will work on ICC/CMYK workflow, mentored by Jon Cruz;
- Soren Berg will create scriptable API, mentored by Ted Gould;
- Krzysztof Kosinski will implement multiple path editing in the Node tool, mentored by bulia byak;
- Arcadie Cracan will improve our somewhat forgotten Connector tool, mentored by Michael Wybrow;
- Marco Cecchetti will further develop lib2geom, mentored by Nathan Hurst.

That makes three new and two returned students. We wish our students and mentors an amazing summer!
