The 7th international conference on Scalable Vector Graphics will take place from October 2-4, 2009, in Mountain View, California, hosted by Google at the Crittenden Campus. At this conference you can learn about subjects varying from specialized technical visualizations to interactive multimedia art. The program includes presentations, beginner and advanced level workshops. And of course you will have the ultimate opportunity to meet people from the SVG community, industry and the W3C SVG Working Group.

The organizing committee is looking for contributors presenting a paper or teaching a course. Presenters are asked to submit an extended abstract in English with an approximate length of 400 to 800 words by May 15 to `svgopen.org`_. The abstracts are reviewed by a reviewing committee and presenters will be informed about acceptance on or before June 26. If your abstract is accepted, you will be asked to submit your full paper by August 31, according to instructions that will be sent to you. Accepted abstracts, papers and presentations will be published in web proceedings.

The list of potential presentation and course topics is `published`_ at SVG Open website. However organizers are still investigating a venue for holding workshops and courses. Potential course instructors are asked to submit a course outline by May 15. The outlines will be reviewed by a committee and instructors will be informed about acceptance on or before June 26.

All Inkscape users and contributors are welcome to attend!
