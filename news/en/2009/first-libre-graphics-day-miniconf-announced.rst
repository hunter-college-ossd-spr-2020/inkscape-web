There are several more possibilities to meet and discuss free graphics tools other than at `Libre Graphics Meeting`_, so it was decided to organize smaller events under same name "Libre Graphics Day". The first one will be organized by Inkscape's developer Jon A. Cruz and held at `linux.conf.au`_ in Wellington, New Zealand, on January 18, 2010. You can submit a proposal for a talk till September 25. Read more at `LGD's website`_ and get involved, either as developer or user!
