Our long time contributor Cédric Gémy just has his first book on Inkscape `published`_. It is written in French and called "Inkscape efficace: Réussir ses dessins vectoriels". It is Cédric's second book after the commercially successful "GIMP Efficace". The book is quite good for beginners, because first 120 pages describe basic tools, color and transformations. The other part of the book is aimed rather at professional users and thoroughly describes how to be more efficient with Inkscape, how to do print jobs and how to do web oriented SVG even if coding is needed. When possible, Cédric tried to give advice to Adobe Illustrator users.
