Title: Inkscape 0.47pre4 is out
Author: prokoudine
Category: Releases
Date: 2009-10-20


Hopefully pre4 is the final prerelease. Please download the `files`_ and let us know if you stumble upon any serious bugs except the infamous crash when undoing changes in live path effects. We probably won't release the final version within next couple of weeks, because we really need the LPE bug fixed.
