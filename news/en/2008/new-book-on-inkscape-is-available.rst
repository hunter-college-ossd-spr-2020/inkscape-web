In early July 2008 a joint Inkscape and `FLOSS Manuals`_ project held a book sprint in Paris sponsored by Google. Half a dozen of contributors from Netherlands, France, USA, Australia and Russia participated at the sprint to create a new user manual in English.

We were asked to do 14 chapters, but we did 35 chapters. The book is now available `on-line`_ free of charge from FLOSS Manuals and for a small fee as `hardcopy`_ from Lulu. The income will go to FLOSS Manuals project that provides the infrastructure for collaborative work on documentation and to Inkscape's documentation team for funding future book sprints.

The documentation team is determined to update the new manual frequently and `invites you`_ to participate at both improving English version and translating it into other languages.

We thank Google for funding the book sprint, FLOSS Manuals for providing great infrastructure that finally made collaborative work on the manual a sweet reality, and organizers of `Open Translation Tools 2007`_ conference for bringing FLOSS Manuals and Inkscape face to face!
