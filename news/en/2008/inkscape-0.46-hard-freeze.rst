Last night we've officially established the release branch that will become the Inkscape 0.46 release once we're confident of its stability. Along with this, we've declared Hard Freeze and String Freeze on this branch, and thus will be focusing on finalizing translations and bug fixing.

Consequently, the SVN main head has returned to free active development on the path to 0.47. For 0.47 a particular focus will be a cleanup of the codebase, refactoring for improved consistency and elimination of duplicate or obsolete code.
