Title: Inkscape 0.46-pre3
Author: bryce
Category: Releases
Date: 2008-03-07


Our third (and probably final) pre-release of Inkscape is available for `download`_.

Unfortunately, we've found that the remainder of our release blocking bugs are Windows-specific issues, but there aren't enough Windows-based developers to solve them all. If you are comfortable programming C/C++ on Windows with Ming32 and are interested in helping ensure the Inkscape Windows port is as stable as on other platforms, we can sure use your help! Review our `bug tracker`_ for windows bug priorities and to submit patches. For more information on Inkscape development on Windows, see our `Win32Port wiki page`_.
