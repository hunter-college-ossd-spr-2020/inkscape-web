Inkscape project is hoping to participate at `Hackontest`_ — a 24 hour programming contest between three teams of open source software projects. The competition is taking place at OpenExpo on September 24-25, 2008 in Zürich, Switzerland. Winners get `prizes`_.

What we need is more ideas and more programmers willing to participate. `Here`_ is the current list of ideas. Feel free to register, login and vote, add an idea and/or volunteer to implement a request.
