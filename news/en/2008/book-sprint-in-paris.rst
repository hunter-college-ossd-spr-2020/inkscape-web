Google has generously sponsored `FLOSS Manuals`_ and Inkscape to run a Book Sprint in Paris, July 5-12. We have people coming from France, Netherlands, USA and Russia to work on a new book on Inkscape.

If you are in Paris at this time and willing to participate, please `join`_ inkscape-docs mailing list and introduce yourself. Of course, you can help us being located in your hometown in just any part of Earth. We have also established an IRC channel (#booksprint at irc.freenode.net) to make remote communication easier.

FLOSS Manuals and Inkscape project first met at `Open Translation Tools 2007`_ conference in Zagreb. We are happy to bring our collaboration with FM to this level and expect seing translations of the new manual rapidly appearing.
