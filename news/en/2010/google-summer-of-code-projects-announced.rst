We are delighted to inform you that five students will be working on Inkscape
this summer to bring a lot of significant improvements, both user visible and
under-the-hood ones.

* Evangelos Katsikaros, mentored by Nathan Hurst, will implement spatiotemporal
  indexing which will improve perfomance of Inkscape.

* Krzysztof Kosinski, mentored by bulia byak, will implement Cairo-based
  rendering. Inkscape already uses Cairo for things like wireframe mode
  rendering, so the rest of it is going to use Cairo now.

* Zhenfeng Zhao, mentored by Johan Engelen, will implement Power Stroke LPE for
  Inkscape. Zhenfeng already did a successful brush related GSoC project for
  GIMP last year.

* Alex Trujillo. mentored by Ted Gould, will rework existing Save/Export
  implementation and improve the Export pane.

* Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Jon Cruz, will C++ify the SP layer and make XML
  nodes private.

We wish all our students and mentors to succeed at the respective projects and
have a lot of fun while doing so!
