On September 2, 2010, Carl Symons led a one-day beginner's computer orientation
class for a `Native American community`_. He was very pleased with the response
to Inkscape:

   "They all wanted Inkscape loaded on their new computers. It is a
   wonder-full, wonderful application. This Native American nation's (Coastal
   Salish) heritage and culture is loaded with arts, in particular totem-like
   images where Inkscape excels. These students were already making exceptional
   images after just a few hours.

   "One girl did a piece with one star, Ctrl-D-ing, tweaking and arranging the
   copies. She was gone into the timelessness of creativity. I think that she
   started with the star tool immediately after launching Inkscape. I showed
   her a couple of things and she was on her way. This girl is also a bead
   artist, and was excited about using Inkscape to envision some beadwork.

   "One student got a big kick out of Inkscaping the tutorialsâ€¦ Another guy was
   drawing caricatures with the calligraphic tool.

   "Inkscape is such a great way for new digital artists to get amazing results
   quickly. There's something valuable about people being able to get a good
   result quickly with Inkscape that makes it a nice tool for artists.  They
   don't have to fight with the technical learning curve."
