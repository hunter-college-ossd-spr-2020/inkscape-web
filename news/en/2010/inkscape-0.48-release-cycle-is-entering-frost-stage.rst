Today we are entering Frost stage in preparation of the 0.48 release. It means
that we are slowing down development of new features and start working actively
on fixing bugs. End of Frost means: most new features are complete, release
notes are more than 90% ready, 300 points for bugfixing are achieved and first
alpha of 0.48 is released.

By the way, we are still ready to listen to your proposals for Google Summer of
Code projects. Students applications started yesterday night. But before you
apply, please introduce yourself in the inkscape-devel mailing list, discuss a
project, find a mentor willing to work with you, and fix a couple of trivial
bugs to learn Inkscape's source code a little.

Stay tuned!
