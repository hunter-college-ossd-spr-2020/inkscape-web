First prelease of upcoming Inkscape 0.48 is out. Please fetch_ source code or a
build for your system, test and report all the issues you run into. There are
just a few blocker issues left. After fixing those we will release last
prerelease and, if all is well, it will be the time for 0.48 final to be out.
