As you probably have already noticed, release of the first planned point
release is delayed. The reason behind this is that we discovered a number of
regressions over 0.47 and a number of bugs in new functionality, so we had to
take some extra time fixing them. There are still some bugs left that we
consider critical for user experience. We will keep you informed on progress.
