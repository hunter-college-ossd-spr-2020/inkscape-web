sK1 team released new version of UniConvertor_ â€” a universal vector graphics
conversion tool that Inkscape uses to open documents like CDR (Corel DRAW), WMF
(Windows Metafiles) and so on.

The new version features file managers integration on Windows and Linux, a
simple user interface, support for embroidery files formats (just importing).
Other changes involve major internal refactoring, better fonts handling and
better color management.

The Windows version contains a script that can be used to patch an existing
installation of Inkscape to use new external version of UniConvertor. You can
download an MSI installer for Windows or binary packages for various Linux
distributions, as well as source code, `right here`_.
