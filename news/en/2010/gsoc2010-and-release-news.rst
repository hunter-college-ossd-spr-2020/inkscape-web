The midterm evaluation is long past. Unfortunately we lost two out of five
students, and that leaves us two projects focusing on performance and one
project focusing on rewriting internals. On the other hand the PowerStroke
project was picked by Johan Engelen, mentor of the student we lost. Overall
progress of projects is quite exciting, more on that soon.

In the mean time we are tracking down the very last crashers to release a new
version that won't disappoint you. By the way, we are still missing a person
who could take care of a native Mac build (that involves Quartz based port of
GTK+). If you are willing to help, please join developers mailing list and tell
us you are ready to work on this.
