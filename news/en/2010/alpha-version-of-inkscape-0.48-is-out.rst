A while ago we released alpha verison of the coming Inkscape 0.48. You can
download the files here_. This alpha version features all things we told you
about before plus recent work by Tavmjong Bah on the text tool options:
numerical input for kerning, baseline shift, word spacing, character rotation
and so on. There will be a number of last minute changes before we announce
feature freeze and finally move to the next stage.
