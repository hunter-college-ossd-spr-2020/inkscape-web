Libre Graphics Meeting is an annual working conference for the free software
graphics application community. Developers from the full spectrum of graphics
applications — image editors, photography, 3-D and 2-D animation, vector art,
graphic design, typography — collaborate with each other on interoperability,
push the state of the art in application functionality and user experience, and
get important face-to-face interaction with users.

Attendance at LGM is free for developers and users alike — so the conference
counts on the generosity of the open source graphics community to help
underwrite the costs of putting on the conference and to help make it possible
for individual open source developers to attend.

Please make a donation to the community fundraising campaign at
http://pledgie.com/campaigns/8926 — and help a free graphics software developer
benefit from the in-person collaboration at this year's LGM. Any amount, no
matter how small, is helpful; many developers in Europe need only a small
stipend for rail travel to make the trip a possibility. All donations are tax
deductible for US taxpayers. For larger donations from corporations and
individuals, contact us directly at lgm(at)gnome.org

Some of Inkscape developers are planning to attend the conference, and Jimmac
(Novell design team, Tango project) is going to give a talk on icon design. To
