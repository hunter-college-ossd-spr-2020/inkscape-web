We are quickly approaching release of final 0.48 version. The plan is to make
sure everything unfinished we wanted disabled is already disabled and most
nasty bugs are gone. Then we shall release tarballs with source code and start
working on binary builds for Windows and Mac.

In the mean time we are just a week away from midterm evaluations for our
Google Summer of Code students. As a quick reminder, this year we have five
students: two working on performance, one implementing PowerStroke live path
effect, one reworking the way Inkscape makes difference between saving and
exporting, and another student rewriting internals. We'll let you know how
respective projects progress after the evaluations.
