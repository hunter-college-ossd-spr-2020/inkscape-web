There's been several news piling up for last couple of weeks.

First of all, About screen contest. The winner is theartcontinuum_ with this_ entry. We thank all participants of the contest for their invaluable creative contributions!

The next news is about bug hunt. We did reach 300 points goal for this stage of release cycle indeed, so now we only need to disable some features that are not going to make it into 0.48 and release an alpha version.

And the last news is a reminder that next week, May 27-30, there will be `Libre Graphics Meeting`_ conference in Brussels. The program_ has finally settled down. There will be two Inkscape related talks: on May 28 Jasper van de Gronde will talk about `diffusion curves`_ in Inkscape, and on May 29 Novell's designer Jakub "Jimmac" Steiner will talk about icon workflows with Inkscape. If you are seriously interested in free design software, this is THE event to attend.
