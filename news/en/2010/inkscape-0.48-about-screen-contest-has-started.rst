Our dearest user community, we are happy to announce that a traditional About
screen contest has started at DeviantArt as a part of preparations for
releasing 0.48 in few months. There is no particular theme this time, so you
are entirely free in your choice. Draw freely, as it were ;-)

Please `read details`_ in the DeviantArt announcement and note that the
deadline for your art submission is April 15. The community judging period will
be from April 16 to April 22, and the TOP3 will be turned over to the
developers for their final decision. Rock on!
