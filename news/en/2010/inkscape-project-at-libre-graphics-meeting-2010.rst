On May 27-30 annual `Libre Graphics Meeting`_ conference has taken place in
Brussels. After several years of being underrepresented at the event Inkscape
project finally featured many of its superheroes and rock stars: Johan Engelen,
Jasper van de Gronde, Felipe Sanches, Tavmjong Bah, Elisa de Castro Guerra,
Ivan Louette, Jon Philips, Jakub Steiner, Cedric Gemy and Andy Fitzsimon.
Unfortunately, two other very important contributors, Jon Cruz and Donna
Benjamin, couldn't make it.

There were three talks covering Inkscape: "Diffusion curves" by Jasper van de
Gronde, "Icon Workflows with Inkscape" by Jakub Steiner and "Inkscape for
everybody" by Andy Fitzsimon. An exceptionally well organized workshop for
Inkscape beginners by Elisa de Castro Guerra nicely complemented the talks.

Videos of all the LGM talks are currently being uploaded to river-valley.tv_
who filmed them. You can also read Tavmjong's notes on the event here_.
