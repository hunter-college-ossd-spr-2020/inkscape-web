Not many people remember this, perhaps, but one of the first extensions ever
written for Inkscape was an assistant tool for designing guitar fingerboards,
written by Aaron Spike. Over time more people found even more interesting uses
for Inkscape. We already reported on Egg-bot recently, but another very
interesting project made its way to upstream collection of extensions just few
days ago.

Since revision 9818 Inkscape comes with GCodetools_ â€” a plug-in that prepares
and converts paths from Inkscape to G-code_ using biarc interpolation. From now
on you will be able to use default Inkscape for all kinds of fun things like
cutting, engraving etc. This feature will be available in the next version,
0.49. Until that you can either use unstable builds or just download the
extension and install it for your current copy of 0.48.
