We'be been tracking all kinds of fancy uses of Inkscape for quite a while, and
this one deserves Fancy with a capital F: Eggbot_. Quoting the official
website:

    The Eggbot is an open-source art robot that can draw on spherical or
    egg-shaped objects from the size of a ping pong ball size to that of a
    small grapefruit — roughly 1.25 to 4.25 inches in diameter (4-10 cm). Super
    adjustable; designed to draw on all kinds of things that are normally
    "impossible" to print on. Not just eggs but golf balls, light bulbs, mini
    pumpkins, and even things like wine glasses — with a bit of work.

    The Eggbot software allows you to control the 'bot from within Inkscape — a
    superb freeware illustration program — on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers.
    You can draw an image directly, trace a photograph, or import designs from
    other programs.
