Builds for Windows_ and Mac_ from Bazaar are available again. These are by no
means *nightly* builds, but they are updated rather frequently. You can use
them to test Inkscape and report bugs. When you do so, please refer to number
of revision that is part of every archive's name. Thank you for your continuous
support and contribution!
