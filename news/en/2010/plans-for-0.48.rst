We've been talking about moving to shorter release cycles for a while now. So
this time for 0.48 we are going to slow down development of new features in the
second half of February, completely move to testing in April and release 0.48
sometime in May.

In the mean time we will do our best to help you help us test the upcoming
version, so we hope to make nightly builds for Windows and Mac available again
soon. We will let you know as soon as everything is sorted out.
