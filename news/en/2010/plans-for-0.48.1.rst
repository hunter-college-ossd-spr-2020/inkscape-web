We have discussed possibility of releasing the first point version, 0.48.1,
with bugfixes and translation updates, and agreed to do it around October 25.
That gives you, our dear community, over a month to report issues and update
translation to have them in the next stable release. We already have fixed a
number of bugs, including a couple of crashers, and there are likely to be some
improvements to the new input devices configuration dialog.

In the mean time we restored broken LiveJournal syndication of news from
inkscape.org, so if you are a LiveJournal user, you can add_ this feed to your
friends list.
