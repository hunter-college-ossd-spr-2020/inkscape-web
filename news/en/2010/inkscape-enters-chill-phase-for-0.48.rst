We are announcing chill phase and thus officially enter 0.48 release cycle. It
means that development of new features now should be wrapping up, and focus
should be shifting to bugfixing activity. So we are really serious about
releasing 0.48 some time in May.

An about screen contest will be announced separately. In the mean time you can
help us by pointing out bugs and odd things in the documentation.
