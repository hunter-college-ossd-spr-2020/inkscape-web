Libre Graphics World published an interview with Inkscape developers and
contributors who worked on release of 0.48, Google Summer of Code 2010 projects
and participated at `Libre Graphics Meeting`_ earlier this year.

In the mean time some new features have already found their way to development
tree for the next version. Thanks to Roland Meuband exchanging position of
objects is now possible in Inkscape (via "Align and Distribute" dialog). Johan
Engelen also started work on PowerStroke live path effect that will beyond all
doubt attract type designers.
