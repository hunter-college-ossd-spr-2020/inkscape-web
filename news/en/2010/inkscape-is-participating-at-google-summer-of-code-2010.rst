It's official now: we are in for Google Summer of Code 2010. In the past years
participation at GSoC was a tremendous success for us, and we are hoping to
gain no less this time. So if you are eligible for GSoC, please have a look at
a `list of project ideas`_ or feel free come up with your own ideas. The
primary place of contact, as usual, is our inkscape-devel_ mailing list.
