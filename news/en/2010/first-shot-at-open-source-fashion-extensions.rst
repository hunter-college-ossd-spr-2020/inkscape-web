During Libre Graphics Meeting 2010 Susan Spencer gave an interesting talk
called `"Open Source project to enable fashion design using open data
formats"`_. Having spoken to various community members during the conference,
Susan then dived into Python programming and finally came up with
proof-of-concept extensions for Inkscape that allow creating clothes pattern
blocks.

If you are interested in this further development of this project or maybe wish
to participate, keep an eye on the blog_. The project now has a new name, TMTP
(tau meta tau physica), and there is a dedicated website in works.
