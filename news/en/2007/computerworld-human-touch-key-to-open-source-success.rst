There's a mention of Inkscape and the Libre Graphics Meeting in an article at `Computerworld`_.

Speaking of the `Libre Graphics Meeting`_, folks from GIMP, Scribus, CREATE, and other projects are are busy setting up our next get-together in Montreal, Canada. This will be held the weekend of May 4-6, 2007. We strongly encourage all Inkscape developers and users to join us. Last year's conference was an invaluable way to meet and directly work with the key developers from Gimp, Scribus, and Blender on topics of common interest. It also proved to be an excellent way for users to learn new tricks and to share ideas directly with developers.

Stay tuned for more info, but make sure to pencil in May 4-6 on your calendars!
