Title: Inkscape 0.45 Hard Freeze
Author: bryce

Aaron and I are ready at this time to declare the Hard Freeze for the 0.45 branch.

From this point until the release, please do not commit to the 0.45 release branch; all changes must be posted as patches to the patch tracker for review and integration by the release wardens (Aaron and I) or translation wardens (Arpad and Cornelius).

There are still a number of critical bugs that probably won't be fixed soon. However, we will plan on producing a 0.45.1 release at a later date where we can catch some of this.

We would also like at this time to declare String Freeze, to assist translators in finalizing their translations. If there are any remaining string issues such as non-translatable strings or fixes to existing strings, please send patches in ASAP.
