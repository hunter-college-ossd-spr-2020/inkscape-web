Our next pre-release for Inkscape 0.45 is downloadable from the `Inkscape SF site`_.

Changes since -pre1 are largely updates to translations and documentation. Unless there are any suprises, this will probably be the last pre-release before the final official release. Problems can be reported to Inkscape's `bug tracker`_.
