We hope you had a great holiday season. Now that you are back, we have some
news for you.

We had a server error that prevented us from posting anything most of December,
but now it's fixed and we are back on track. The usual news posting resumes,
and the website now also has an initial Books_ section. In fact there is a
whole new website coming, based on design_ by Hinerangi Courtenay.

The other good news is that 0.48.1 is done, and we are waiting for Ted to cut
the release so that packagers could start packaging. We are also determined to
make at least one more point release before it's time for 0.49. Stay tuned for
more news!
