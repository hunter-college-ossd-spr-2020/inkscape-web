You can `submit`_ applications for `Google Summer of Code`_ projects now. We still require you to join inkscape-devel@ `mailing list`_ to introduce yourself and tell us which project you would like to do. Use `ideas page`_, `blueprints`_ or come up with your own idea, but make sure you found a potential mentor, discussed your application and submitted it till April 8.
