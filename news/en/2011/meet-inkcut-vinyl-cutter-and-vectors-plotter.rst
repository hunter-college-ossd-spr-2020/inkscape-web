We already reported before that with projects like Egg-Bot and GCode we seem to be gaining a strong manufacturing community. Another project we'd like to spread awareness of is `InkCut`_ — an Inkscape extension that allows "printing" on cutters and plotters. InkCut was created by Jairus Martin and currently works on Linux, with Windows support coming in the next version.

InkCut supports cutters with both serial and printer interface. Jairus maintains a `list of cutters`_ known to work (mostly various models by Roland, Summagraphics, Graphtec, US Cutter). The project's page has a nice step-by-step `tutorial`_ to get you started. If you have questions or want to share your experience of using InkCut, you can join the existing community of InkCut users at `inkscapeforum.com`_.
