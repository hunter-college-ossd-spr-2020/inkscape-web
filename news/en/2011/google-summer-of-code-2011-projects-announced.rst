As mentoring organization in `Google Summer of Code`_ program we will be working with four students this year:

- Abhishek Sharma will work on `better use of CSS`_ in Inkscape generated SVG documents.
- Fernando Lucchesi Bastos Jurema will `improve the JavaScript support`_, enhancing the existing UI.
- Krzysztof Kosinski will continue working on Cairo based rendering started last year and `will further improve performance`_ using several methods of caching.
- David Xiong will work on `KML support`_ that will enhance Inkscape's digital mapping capablities.

As you can see, the students will be focusing on clean-up and performance boost which goes in line with primary objectives of current v0.49 development cycle that is, essentially, all about refactoring. The real work will begin end of May, and the projects should be completed end of August. We are looking forward to working with our students and will keep you updated on their progress.
